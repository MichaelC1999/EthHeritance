EthHeritance is a dApp where a depositor stakes Eth into the smart contract and upon triggering a dead-man's switch is divided and sent to all listed heir addresses. This app runs on the Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet. The staked Eth earns 400 HeirCoin (this application's native token) per Eth per day, to be divided between heirs upon disbursal. The documentation page on the app has further instructions. While this app is not very practical for real world use, this project is was an exercise in designing smart contracts with transactions between wallets in one-to-many, many-to-one, and one-to-one relationships. As gas costs make these straightforward processes into more complicated operations, various functions had to be rewritten multiple times.
